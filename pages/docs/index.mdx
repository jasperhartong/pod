# üìì Open Takeaways
<sub>by Jasper Hartong</sub>

_Many side-projects come and go, some stick around slightly longer, but most of them never outgrow there initial best intentions._

_Just making the code publicly available and calling that "Open Source" doesn't feel like adding much value for anyone. So, I'm trying something else:_

_**"Open Takeaways" (OT)**: short articles containing ideas, code-fragments and demo's with the intention to guide others that tackle similar challenges._

## Side-project: "Tapes.me"

<ReadMore moreText="Continue the backstory..." lessText="Hide backstory">

One week after the COVID19 lock-down began in the Netherlands (march 2020), my mother thought of a nice way to keep in touch with her grandchildren (my nieces and nephew).

She started picking out children books to read, recording herself on her iMac (she's so tech-savvy ‚ù§Ô∏è) and queueing up recordings to send inside our family WhatsApp Group. Lovely and Brilliant!

I was immediatly inspired by her idea.. my code-nerve started itching..

Some opportunities for improvement I saw in the above process:

* WhatsApp Groups are not really made for persistent storage: the recordings just dissappear between other conversations
* The recording and queuing of episodes was quite a hassle on the iMac (often requiring the help of my dad)
* There was not a simple way for my nieces and nephew to listen back to chapters by themselves
* This whole process the whole process sounded like some form of private Podcasting to me.. shoulnd't it just be that?

So I set down and created Tapes.me, an web-app consisting of:

* A "recording room", for my mom to add new episodes, record and publish them
* A "listening room", for the kids to easily pick episodes to listen to
* An RSS feed, for the parents to subscribe to in their Podcast App

After it was finished.. the lock-down started to loosen up again and this whole thing dwindled down with it. So now there's a private podcasting web-app, with no users left for it, brilliant :)

NB: Of course this project has two names, which side-project doesn't? You need to pick a repository name way early in the process ‚Äì "pod". Then, a few days in, you decide to buy a domain name ‚Äì "tapes.me" ‚Äì which becomes the actual name from then on. Right?
