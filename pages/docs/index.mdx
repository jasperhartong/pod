# üìì Tapes.me: Open-Takeaways

## What's Open-Takeaways?

Many side-projects come and go, some stick around slightly longer, but most of them never outgrow there initial best intentions. Making the repository public and calling that code dump "open-source" also doesn't feel like much value to anyone.

So, let's try something else: **"Open-Takeaways"**. Sharing code-fragments, ideas and demo's of these side-projects within easy to read articles. Not with the intention of continueing the project in the open, but to guide others that tackle similar challenges with actual implementations.

Jump to [my open-takeaways](#open-takeaways) if you want to skip the backstory.

## The backstory of Pod / Tapes.me

One week after the COVID19 lock-down began in the Netherlands (march 2020), my mother thought of a nice way to keep in touch with her grandchildren (my nieces and nephew). She started picking out children books to read, recording herself on her iMac (she's so tech-savvy ‚ù§Ô∏è) and queueing up recordings to send inside our family WhatsApp Group. Lovely and Brilliant!

I was immediatly inspired by her idea.. my code-nerve started itching..

Some opportunities for improvement I saw in the above process:

* WhatsApp Groups are not really made for persistent storage: the recordings just dissappear between other conversations
* The recording and queuing of episodes was quite a hassle on the iMac (often requiring the help of my dad)
* There was not a simple way for my nieces and nephew to listen back to chapters by themselves
* This whole process the whole process sounded like some form of private Podcasting to me.. shoulnd't it just be that?

So I set down and created Tapes.me, an web-app consisting of:

* A "recording room", for my mom to add new episodes, record and publish them
* A "listening room", for the kids to easily pick episodes to listen to
* A RSS feed, for the parents to subscribe to in their Podcast App

After it was finished.. the lock-down started to loosen up again and this whole thing dwindled down with it. So now there's a private podcasting web-app, with no users left for it, brilliant :)

NB: Of course this project has two names, which side-project doesn't? You need to pick a repository name way early in the process. Then, a few days in, you decide to buy a domain name which becomes the actual name from then on. Right?

* A React Hook abstracting away audio recording controls
* A React recorder button component mimicking iOS Voice Memos
* A React component for visualizing incoming recordings
* Several gotcha's about implementing audio recording on the web

-------

### üåè Signed S3 uploading in React `(coming soon)`

* A serverless endpoint for retrieving signed URL's
* A React Hook for signed media uploading
* A React Component for dropping files

-------

### üïπ An RPC API experiment `(coming soon)`

* Sharing as much code as possible between client and server
* A React Hook for calling serverside methods savely
* Using io-ts to add typesafety to unknown objects
* On response interface all the way down

-------

### üíæ An experiment with storing relationships in DynamoDB `(coming soon)`

-------

Other possible topics:

* DirectusDB backend
